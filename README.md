### About
Porky is a free currency conversion application built and deployed as an extension on the Google Chrome Web Store. Its purpose is to simply help people get real time data/information on currency exchange rates (between two currencies). This application's source code is made public to help any user or developers understand that it complies with the privacy practices mentioned on the web store. The name porky was given to the application/extension as pigs were revered as symbols of good fortune and money during the old days.

If you would like to see the extension, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/porky-the-currency-conver/oipnhacgfflaanfephchpgjkkcdncekd/related">click here</a>.
